Hey {name},

Thanks for being a valuable Trusted Tester of Yupp. Your feedback so far has given us invaluable insights and we continue to iterate on the product! We hope you are enjoying your experience and finding Yupp useful, and ask for your strict confidentiality in this phase 🙏.

We are thrilled to release our ‘referral’ feature. With this functionality, you would be able to invite your friends, using a special invite code created just for you. This feature would start rolling out to other users in the upcoming weeks, but we thought it would be great to let you in early.

Click on your profile picture, and you will see “Refer your friends”. When you click on it, you will see your special invite code.

Ask your friends to visit https://gg.yupp.ai, login using their gmail id, and enter your invite code when prompted. And that’s it, they are in. Note: There’s a limit on the number of friends you can invite per week.

And well, that’s not all - the referral program gets you 10000 extra YUPP credits and your friend 1000! Please refer your friends now.  One extra request - please don’t refer to journalists, investors, competitors etc. and continue to keep the product confidential. We want to remain in stealth for now.

Thank you for being a part of this journey with us 🫶🏼.

Cheers,

Mouli

Hey {name},

We’re thrilled to have you as an early Trusted Tester user! Your feedback will play a crucial role in refining the product, and we can’t wait to hear your thoughts.

Thank you for being a part of this small, exclusive group with access to the product in its private, closed beta. We really appreciate your trust and feedback, and ask for your strict confidentiality in this phase 🙏.

Before you dive in, here are a few important points to note:
• Confidential Access: This early access is exclusive to you, so please refrain from sharing it with others. Your discretion is greatly appreciated. 🔐
• Logging: To help us improve, we’ll be logging extensively. Please avoid writing any prompts that you consider confidential. 🔍
• It’s early: The product is in its early stages, so you may encounter some rough edges or unexpected issues. We appreciate your patience as we work to improve!
• Try it out now! Send a prompt - whatever's on your mind - to the AIs, and share a quick feedback on which one you prefer. We will give you a one-time 1000 YUPP credits as a bonus.

For updates, AI discussions with our devs (and other Trusted Testers like yourself), and funny memes, join our nascent Discord community here: https://discord.gg/AGHSbyqgXP
