Hey {email_recipient_name},

Thanks for joining {BRAND_NAME}—we're stoked to have you on board.

How's your experience been so far? Any feedback or questions for us?

Also just a friendly reminder, {BRAND_NAME} is still in stealth mode. This means we're still keeping {BRAND_NAME} under wraps for now. Please keep your experience confidential and don't share details on social media (or elsewhere) just yet.

Thanks for your cooperation!

Anyways, using {BRAND_NAME} is easy! If you want a walkthrough, we're more than happy to show you.

It's been 5 weeks since we last saw you on {BRAND_NAME}. Just checking in to see if you're still around—your AI crew misses you!

If you're still interested in using {BRAND_NAME}, we'd love to have you back! However, if you're not planning on using the app, we'll be deactivating your account in about a week's time. No big deal, just a heads up.
We do this to minimize the surface area while we are in the early alpha phase of the product.
