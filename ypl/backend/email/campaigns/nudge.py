Hey {name},

Thanks for joining {BRAND_NAME}—we're stoked to have you on board.

How's your experience been so far? Any feedback or questions for us?

Also just a friendly reminder, {BRAND_NAME} is still in stealth mode. This means we're still keeping {BRAND_NAME} under wraps for now. Please keep your experience confidential and don't share details on social media (or elsewhere) just yet.

Thanks for your cooperation!
